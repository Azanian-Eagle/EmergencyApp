# EmergencyApp
A sample code for the app that sends push notifications to emergency contacts, either through the app or via email or text if they're not registered

This is a high-level code and assumes the existence of libraries for push notifications, geolocation, and camera access. You'll need to install these libraries and write the actual code for sending emails and texts.
